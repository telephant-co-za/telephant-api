# Deliverables

The deliverables for the assignment are listed below.

## Github Repo

The Telephant API source code can be found in the github repositories indicated below. 

**Note:** Because of the commercial nature of the app, a separate Telephant account was created, and the required repositories were set to 'pivate' to protect the system's integrity. As collaborators, the lecturers have been invited to review the work on the Telephant repository.

## Zoom Meeting

A meeting will be scheduled on the Zoom platform with the appropriate lectures to further explain the applications and their inner workings.

## Links

The API links are:

* [https://api.telephant.co.za](https://api.telephant.co.za).  This link will take you to a live API implementation. This is a live API that does not use demo data. Heroku is the platform where it is hosted.  Heroku's application is updated on a regular basis thanks to a continuous integration.  MongoDB Atlas is used to host the NoSQL database of the API.

* [http://developer.telephant.co.za/](http://developer.telephant.co.za/) - The API documentation has been generated using the Redoc library on a live webpage. It is hosted on AWS S3.

* [http://www.telephant.co.za/](http://www.telephant.co.za/) - The service's landing page.  It is hosted on AWS S3.
