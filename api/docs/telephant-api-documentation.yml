  title: Telephant API
  description: |
    *The mechanism for swapping airtime is powered by Telephant's APIs. Developers can use the API to tap into the platform's capabilities and incorporate the service into their own apps.*

    The Telephant API's backbone is HTTP. The nature of our API is RESTful. It has a set of predictable resource URLs. It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors. It also accepts JSON as an HTTP body payload and returns it, along with some other useful formats.
    
    You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language or an HTTP client like Postman or CURL to use Telephant's API.

    Happy programming **:-)**

    ## HTTP Response Status Codes
    HTTP response status codes show whether or not a particular HTTP request was completed successfully. Section 10 of RFC 2616 defines the status codes listed below. RFC 7231 contains an updated specification.

    Telephant API makes use of the following HTTP status codes, grouped into three classes:

    ### Successful Responses - 2XX

    #### 200 - OK

    The request has succeeded.

    #### 201 - Created

    As a result of the request's success, a new resource has been generated. This is the response that is normally sent in response to POST or some PUT queries.

    ### Client Error - 4XX
    
    #### 400 - Bad Request
    Due to incorrect syntax, the server was unable to understand the request.
    
    #### 401 - Unauthorized
    Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
    
    #### 403 - Forbidden
    The server refuses to provide the requested resource because the client does not have access permissions to the resource; that is, it is unauthorized. Unlike 401, the server is aware of the client's identity.
    
    #### 404 - Not Found
    The requested resource was not found. The client is free to make additional requests.
    
    #### 405 - Method Not Allowed
    A GET request on a form that needs data to be presented via POST, or a PUT request on a read-only resource, for example, is not supported for the requested resource.

    ### Server Error - 5XX

    #### 500 - Internal Server Error
    The server has come upon a circumstance that it is unsure how to handle.  Our team will be reviewing the root cause of issues and resolving the problems as soon as possible.

    ## Headers

    ### Accept
    Clients can send requests with varied values for the 'Accept' header, and the response format will be adjusted to accommodate the request. This is supplied to make interacting with browsers and other clients easier. It's worth noting that only JSON-formatted success and error messages will be returned. The API is designed to return JSON in general, hence the functionality is not further documented.

    #### Mime Types Accepted:
    - text/plain - will return a string of text
    - text/html - will return a formatted table of results
    - application/json - will return formatted json
    - text/csv - will return results in a downloadable CSV file

    ### account_id Header
    Clients can send requests as a separate account associated to the username by including the account_id header, which should contain the Telephant account ID of the account the client desires to act on.
